I am a developer living in Nairobi. I see myself as a freelance developer due to my many projects not tied to any company house.

I have worked for Virtual City Limited based in Nairobi as one of their first Hardware Engineering Interns, and helped build and grow their products for the Agricultural market. Being a front end web developer I learnt so much about mobile and web application development using many of Microsoft's products.

This has inspired me to self-educate myself in a wide variety of programming languages over the years. So thank you Virtual Family!

Many people do not believe I can make a responsive website or blog because I have an Accounting major, it is with this perception I get to capitalize on my potential and passion to prove my abilities for the better good of all of us.
