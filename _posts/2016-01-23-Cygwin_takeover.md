[Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) is the revolution of command-line interfaces in windows, think of it as [gitbash](https://git-for-windows.github.io/), Windows command prompt and UNIX shell all in one! That's not just the only thing you get; you also get to rebuild it from source, write your own sh/bash scripts and commands, add lots of [packages](https://cygwin.com/packages/package_list.html). **How cool is that?!**

I currently use Cygwin with my own personal holy scroll of awesome shell script. If you are a _Linux_ fan you know the feeling when you get to pick colors for your terminal or if you love batch programming you know how it feels to get your own scripts even your name echoed in command-line.

Some of you would'nt want all that hustle!! try [Babun](http://babun.github.io/) shell instead, it is a two shell pre-configuration featuring cool software development tools.![image](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/4e/5c/f7/4e5cf7d4ccb9c59b6620a9c71944d51e.jpg)
