[Garam Editor]( http://jgodwin13.github.io/Garam-Editor ) is a Free Advanced Notepad. It is still a project in the works but I managed to get a beta release out dubbed the _~Dvorty girl~_ which was released on 2016-08-01. If you want to contribute to the project, currently you can send your commits to [Garam-Editor Repo](https://github.com/jgodwin13/Garam-Editor)

[_**Try v1.0.0.3(beta)**_](http://bit.ly/1O7QxvX)
