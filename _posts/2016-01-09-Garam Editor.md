[Garam Editor](https://garameditor.codeplex.com/) is a Free Advanced Notepad. It is still a project in the works but I managed to get a beta release out dubbed the _~Dvorty girl~_ which was released on 2016-08-01. If you want to contribute to the project, currently you can send your commits to [Garam-Editor Repo](https://github.com/Gochojr/Garam-Editor)
