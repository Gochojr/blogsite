[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a very simpler way of making websites more especially blogs. It only uses your content written in markdown or textile or liquid to generate a beautiful blog of static pages. And guess what you can host it on [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) for free.

### Lets get started with Jekyll:

There are certain prerequisties you should have installed in your pc for you to use Jekyll. Here they are guessing that you use windows:

1. [Ruby 2.0.0p576](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) 
2. [Ruby DevKit](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)
3. [Python v2.7.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
4. [Rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge)
