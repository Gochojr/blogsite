Anyone who has a keen eye for good typefonts always chooses TrueTypes because of their preciseness right down to particular pixelations. A while back I had a problem with Helvetica typefont which I could not find on Windows 8.1, funny enough there was no way I could download from official sites because there were no provisions for my Os. Hopefully I stumbled upon [Kelvetica Nobis](http://www.fontspace.com/category/Helvetica) which merely substitutes Helvetica but its worth it.

After digging some more over the internet I found a website with big repository of fonts which literally blew my mind. [Click to see the typefonts](http://www.1001freefonts.com/)
